CHANGE LOG for Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software


Version 5beta2  20-Aug-94
-------------------------

Modified 2-pass quantization (jquant2.c) for better results in RGB color
space.

cjpeg -smooth failed on images with (height mod 16) = 1 or 2.

Tweaked memory manager allocation heuristics to reduce wasted memory.

"cjpeg -dct float" didn't work on compilers that promote unsigned char
to unsigned int, rather than int as specified by ANSI.

configure & ckconfig.c didn't correctly recognize unsigned right shift
on machines with 64-bit-wide longs.

configure now detects inline-function bug in DEC AXP compiler.

Worked around unsigned-comparison bug on Cray C90.

When using ansi2knr, don't assume cc honors -o switch.  Also ensure
"make libjpeg.a" will build ansi2knr if needed.


Version 5beta1  28-July-94
--------------------------

Changes from 5alpha4:

Made default DCT method configurable.

Fixed overflow bug on machines where size_t is wider than int.

Improved checking of improper memory manager configuration.

Corrected very long-standing bug in rdgif.c: could fail when input
GIF image contains single-byte data blocks.

New test image is slightly larger to catch 64K-boundary bugs.
It's more politically correct, too :-)


Changes from version 4
----------------------

Version 5 represents a nearly complete redesign and rewrite of the IJG
software.  Major user-visible changes include:
  * Automatic configuration simplifies installation for most Unix systems.
  * A range of speed vs. image quality tradeoffs are supported.
    This includes resizing of an image during decompression: scaling down
    by a factor of 1/2, 1/4, or 1/8 is handled very efficiently.
  * New programs rdjpgcom and wrjpgcom allow insertion and extraction
    of text comments in a JPEG file.

The application programmer's interface to the library has changed completely.
Notable improvements include:
  * We have eliminated the use of callback routines for handling the
    uncompressed image data.  The application now sees the library as a
    set of routines that it calls to read or write image data on a
    scanline-by-scanline basis.
  * The application image data is represented in a conventional interleaved-
    pixel format, rather than as a separate array for each color channel.
    This can save a copying step in many programs.
  * The handling of compressed data has been cleaned up: the application can
    supply routines to source or sink the compressed data.  It is possible to
    suspend processing on source/sink buffer overrun, although this is not
    supported in all operating modes.
  * All static state has been eliminated from the library, so that multiple
    instances of compression or decompression can be active concurrently.
  * JPEG abbreviated datastream formats are supported, ie, quantization and
    Huffman tables can be stored separately from the image data.
  * And not only that, but the documentation of the library has improved
    considerably!


The last widely used release before the version 5 rewrite was version 4A of
18-Feb-93.  Change logs before that point have been discarded, since they
are not of much interest after the rewrite.
