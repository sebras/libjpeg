CHANGELOG for Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software

Version 2  13-Dec-91
--------------------

Documentation improved a little --- there are man pages now.
Installation instructions moved from README to a separate file SETUP.

New program config.c is provided to help you get the configuration options
right.  This should make installation a lot more foolproof.

Sense of djpeg -D switch reversed: dithering is now ON by default.

RLE image file support added (thanks to Mike Lijewski).

Targa image file support added (thanks to Lee Crocker).

PPM input now accepts all PPM and PGM files.

Bug fix: on machines where 'int' is 16 bits, high-Q-setting JPEG files
were not decoded correctly.

Numerous changes to improve portability.  There should be few or no compiler
warnings now.

Makefiles cleaned up; defaults now appropriate for production use rather than
debugging.

Subroutine interface cleaned up.  If you wrote code based on version 1's
jcmain/jdmain, you'll need to change it, but it should get a little shorter
and simpler.


Version 1   7-Oct-91
--------------------

Initial public release.
