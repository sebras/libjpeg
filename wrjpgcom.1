.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B wrjpgcom
reads the named JPEG/JFIF file, or the standard input if no file is named,
and generates a new JPEG/JFIF file on standard output.  A comment block is
added to the file.
.PP
The JPEG standard allows "comment" (COM) blocks to occur within a JPEG file.
Although the standard doesn't actually define what COM blocks are for, they
are widely used to hold user-supplied text strings.  This lets you add
annotations, titles, index terms, etc to your JPEG files, and later retrieve
them as text.  COM blocks do not interfere with the image stored in the JPEG
file.  The maximum size of a COM block is 64K, but you can have as many of
them as you like in one JPEG file.
.PP
.B wrjpgcom
adds a COM block, containing text you provide, to a JPEG file.
Ordinarily, the COM block is added after any existing COM blocks; but you
can delete the old COM blocks if you wish.
.SH OPTIONS
Switch names may be abbreviated, and are not case sensitive.
.TP
.B \-replace
Delete any existing COM blocks from the file.
.TP
.BI \-comment " text"
Supply text for new COM block on command line.
.PP
If you have only one line of comment text to add, you can provide it on the
command line with
.BR \-comment .
The comment text must be surrounded with quotes so that it is treated as a
single argument.
.PP
If your comment text is longer than one line, omit the
.B \-comment
switch from the command line.  In this case
.B wrjpgcom
will read the comment text from standard input (an input file name MUST be
supplied so that the source JPEG file comes from somewhere else).  You can
enter multiple lines, up to 64KB worth.  Type an end-of-file indicator
(usually control-D) to terminate the comment text entry.
.PP
.B wrjpgcom
will not add a COM block if the provided comment string is empty.  Therefore
\fB\-replace \-comment ""\fR can be used to delete all COM blocks from a file.
.SH EXAMPLES
